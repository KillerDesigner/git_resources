to initialize a repository, first go to Github and create a repo from your account.

at the command line type:

git init

then: 

git commit -m "first commit"

then: 
git remote add origin https://github.com/your_github_name/your_repo_name.git

then:
git push -u origin master

This will set up a repo for your code where you can save things you don't want to lose if your laptop gets stolen, or...

You will make many new repos over your time at WDI. It will be fun to look back on all of it later!

A fun command-line tutorial on Github can be had by typing the following at the command line: 

brew install githug

A bunch of stuff will spew out while it's installing, magic! Then you can type "githug" at the command line and follow the instructions!
